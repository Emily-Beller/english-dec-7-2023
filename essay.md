Delete this fake paragraph and replace it with your own paragraphs (introduction, body, and conclusion) that establish that answers your choice of the prompts above and provides ample evidence and reason. Your introduction should include the title and author as a way of referencing where the quotes that you will include came from. The Great Gatsby, title italicized, was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. You can reference the critical essay you use by referring to the authors last name (as long as it is one from our Unit Reader). If you do any outside research, you will need to provide a MLA citation for that (works cited and parenthetical). You may leave your choice of the prompt above or put the prompt number in your title.

In The Great Gatsby, Scott Fitzgerald uses the story of Jay Gatsby and Daisy to show how the human mind always tries to hold on to its existing perceptions, and demonstrate the pittfalls of the American Dream, even when it works exactly as promised. 

In The Great Gatsby, Scott Fitzgerald utalizes the discrepancies between character's self-perception and the reader's more external perception of them to demonstrate how caught up in our own worlds we can be, and how the human mind works to preserve its own status quo. Tom (ex) Nick (ex)
