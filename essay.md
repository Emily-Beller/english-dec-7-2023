The Great Gatsby Essay

In The Great Gatsby, Scott Fitzgerald uses the story of Jay Gatsby and Daisy to show how the human mind always tries to hold on to its existing perceptions, and demonstrate the pittfalls of the American Dream, even when it works exactly as promised. Gatsby spend a large portion of his life working to attain an ideal of wealth and status, in the hope of impressing Daisy who left him on those grounds. Even after years of separation, Gatsby  holds on to her past perception of Daisy, and it catches him completely off gaurd when she demonstrates her own change. The American Dream promises wealth and status as an end goal, but Gatsby only saw it as a means to the end of reuniting with Daisy, something it could not provide.

"One of the first great lessons of my adulthood was this: I change. As I grow, Ps my dreams change, as do my ideas about who I can be and what I want during the short time I am alive. Gatsby has not learned this. It is a lesson he has closed himself to. From the moment he meets Daisy, his ideas about who he is and what he wants and what he can become are immutable."
