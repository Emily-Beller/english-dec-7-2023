The Great Gatsby Essay

Prompt: What does The Great Gatsby ultimately suggest about human perception, illusions, and dreams —and potentially about the American Dream? 
a. Take a position on this question based on your interpretation of the novel’s meaning. 
b. Analyze how Fitzgerald uses narrative elements (such as plot structure, scene development, and characterization) and literary devices (such as imagery, symbolism, and irony) to convey a central theme in the novel related to perceptions, illusions, and dreams. 
c. Use specific evidence from your reading and analysis of the text and at least one critical source.

Delete this fake paragraph and replace it with your own paragraphs (introduction, body, and conclusion) that establish that answers your choice of the prompts above and provides ample evidence and reason. Your introduction should include the title and author as a way of referencing where the quotes that you will include came from. The Great Gatsby, title italicized, was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. You can reference the critical essay you use by referring to the authors last name (as long as it is one from our Unit Reader). If you do any outside research, you will need to provide a MLA citation for that (works cited and parenthetical). You may leave your choice of the prompt above or put the prompt number in your title.
